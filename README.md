-This project demonstrates a cloud-connected temperature controller using the NodeMCU (ESP8266). 
-The system monitors real-time temperature using a sensor, uploads the data to the Thingspeak cloud, and controls a heating or cooling device based on user-defined thresholds. 
-The project is designed for IoT-based applications like smart homes, industrial temperature monitoring, or remote-controlled climate systems.
