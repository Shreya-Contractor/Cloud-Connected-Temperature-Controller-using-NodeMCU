<p>This project demonstrates a cloud-connected temperature controller using the NodeMCU (ESP8266). </p>
<p>The system monitors real-time temperature using a DHT11 sensor, uploads the data to the Thingspeak cloud, and controls a heating or cooling device based on user-defined thresholds. </p>
<p>The project is designed for IoT-based applications like smart homes, industrial temperature monitoring, or remote-controlled climate systems.</p>
